# GLUCOAST

**_GLUCOAST is an all-in-one dashboard to assist diabetics in managing their glucose levels throughout the day._**

We help users to track their blood sugar (glucose) levels throughout the day, by keeping a log of different variables and how they affected their blood sugar levels. GLUCOAST’s goal is to help you coast throughout the day by making informed decisions on how to manage your glucose levels without unintentionally causing glucose levels to rise or crash during your day, which is a diabetic’s biggest daily challenge.

I created GLUCOAST as my capstone project for BrainStation's Software Engineering bootcamp. In two weeks, we were required to develop a full-stack application utilizing the various technologies we learned throughout the semester. GLUCOAST's front-end was developed with React and the back-end runs an Express server on Node. More info regarding future updates to come soon! Future implementations will include user authorization and multiple user databases, third party API inclusion and user suggestions based on past data.

This is a React application. The front-end is fully responsive from mobile to desktop viewports with dynamic data visualization, and the back-end runs Express on top of NodeJS supporting database CRUD operations. Sample data has been prepopulated within the datebase for one user with the ability to add, edit and delete data. Creating this project was a great utilization of the skills I learned in my bootcamp experience and utilizing my skills to develop a fully functioning full-stack application.

Thanks for checking out my work! Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or to connect.
