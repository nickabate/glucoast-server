# GLUCOAST

**_GLUCOAST is an all-in-one dashboard to assist diabetics in managing their glucose levels throughout the day._**

We help users to track their blood sugar (glucose) levels throughout the day, by keeping a log of different variables and how they affected their blood sugar levels. GLUCOAST’s goal is to help you coast throughout the day by making informed decisions on how to manage your glucose levels without unintentionally causing glucose levels to rise or crash during your day, which is a diabetic’s biggest daily challenge.

I created GLUCOAST as my capstone project for BrainStation's Software Engineering bootcamp. In two weeks, we were required to develop a full-stack application utilizing the various technologies we learned throughout the semester. GLUCOAST's front-end was developed with React and the back-end runs an Express server on Node. More info regarding future updates to come soon!

Thanks for checking out my work.
